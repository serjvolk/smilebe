			<p class="darkGray">TopLash is exclusively sold online at Toplash.com We ship our products to most countries. You can see the list of countries in the checkout page. If you do not see your country as an option during checkout, please contact us for more information.</p>
			<h2>ORDER PROCESSING</h2>
			<p>Orders must be placed by 11:59 PM PT to start processing on next business day. Processing time usually takes 1-2 business day of receipt (processing time does not include weekends and holidays). These times may be extended during holidays, launches/restocks, limited edition releases and promotions. Orders placed on Saturday and Sunday will be processed the following Monday. All purchases are subject to credit authorization prior to processing. Only authorized purchases may be processed and shipped.</p>
			<p>Once you have completed your order, you will receive an order confirmation email with order details. Once your order ships, a shipping confirmation email will be sent to the email address associated with your order within 24-48 hours. A link will also be included with tracking information to check the status of your order.</p>
			<p>If you do not receive an order confirmation email, please be sure to check the email address associated with your order, check your Spam/Junk/Trash email folder as well.</p>
			<p>Order confirmation emails may be delayed as a result of high order volume. Please contact our customer service team if you have not received your confirmation email within 24-48 hours of your purchase.</p>
			<h2>ORDER DELIVERY</h2>
			<p>Once shipped, delivery time within the United States is 2-5 days and 7-15 business days internationally. These times may be extended during holidays, launches/restocks and promotions. The estimated time of delivery can be delayed due to transit conditions and/or customs processing for international orders. We do not offer expedited shipping at this time. All domestic orders are shipped via USPS and international orders via USPS or DHL. (Shipping fees, delivery options &amp; courier vary depending on your order and ship-to country/location).</p>
			<p>Please note, we are not responsible for any shipping deliveries that may be affected by, but not limited to, the following: customs, emergency service suspension, natural occurrences, air/ground transportation strikes/delays or transfers from USPS to the local carrier in your country, nor any extra fees, customs or back end charges once the package has exited the United States.</p>
			<p>Packages undeliverable by courier and/or their international shipping partners will be cancelled and refunded once received and processed at our fulfillment center.</p>
			<p>Items shipped outside of the United States are subject to duties, taxes, handling and/or other miscellaneous charges as defined by the country of import. These fees are not included in the cost of your order and therefore can not be reimbursed by TopLash. Customs regulations in the U.S.A. require that we display the full product value on the front of the package (this includes products that are purchased at a discounted price or are part of a promotion). Please check with your country’s customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to placing your order.</p>
			<p>We collect Sales Tax, where applicable, and pay it to the state to which we’ve shipped your merchandise. It’s a State Tax regulation. City, Local and Special taxes may also apply.</p>
			<p>These policies are subject to change without notice.</p>
